# NIH_clinicalStudies
# Clinical Trials Evaluation & Status Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes NIH-linked clinical trial data to evaluate research study outcomes, completion rates, and therapeutic focus areas.
Using Python and data analysis libraries, the workflow cleans raw clinical studies data, calculates key performance metrics, and generates visual reports to support program evaluation and decision-making


##  Objectives
- Import and clean clinical trial datasets
- Validate and standardize study information
- Measure study completion rates
- Analyze research topic trends using keyword matching
- Generate visual reports for stakeholders
- Automate reproducible analysis


## Tools & Technologies
- Python 3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

##  Workflow

### 1️ Load Data
Reads raw CSV clinical trial data into Pandas.

### 2️ Clean & Validate
- Standardizes column names
- Removes duplicates
- Checks data structure

### 3️ Compute Metrics
- Total number of studies
- Study status counts
- Completion rate (% completed)

### 4️ Visualizations
Automatically generates:
- Study Status Distribution (bar chart)
- Keyword Topic Analysis chart

Charts are saved to the Reports/ folder for easy sharing.
